## Explanation of the purpose of each file in our repository:
The closet.json file is a dictionary containing dictionaries of clothing options that are sorted through in our main program.
The weather.csv contains data of weather and precipitation levels and is converted into a dataframe in our main program.
Closet_Project.py is our main program.
